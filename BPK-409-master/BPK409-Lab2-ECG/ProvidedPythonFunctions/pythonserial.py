"""This code creates a serial communication with the microcontroller that is connected
via USB. The code needs to output 2 values. In the ECG that is the activation and the time.
The Arduino serial monitor needs to be closed for this code to run.

The code also saves the file of the collected data with the specified savename in
the current working directory, as a .txt file.

To do: change the savename and change the serial port that you are using.
You can find the serial port number in your Arduino Software at Tools-->Port

Just disconnect the microcontroller from the computer to stop the data collection."""
